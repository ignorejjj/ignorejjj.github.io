<!-- ## About Me -->
<a id="about-me"></a>
Hello! I am a graduate student at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, where I am pursuing my combined Master's and Ph.D. degree under the guidance of Prof. Zhicheng Dou. My anticipated graduation is in 2029.

My primary research interests lie in advancing information retrieval through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the application of large language models (LLMs) for next-generation IR, and the development of general-purpose AI agents. I am also deeply interested in how AI can enhance everyday life, particularly through practical and user-friendly products.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss research collaborations, share ideas, or simply have a conversation about AI and its potential. You can contact me at jinjiajie@ruc.edu.cn.
